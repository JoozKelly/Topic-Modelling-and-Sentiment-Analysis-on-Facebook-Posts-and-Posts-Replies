# Topic-Modelling-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Facebook-Posts-and-Posts-Replies
Application of Text Mining on Social Media

This project looks to study Facebook users’ opinions/sentiments using texts that can be found within various datasets containing Facebook posts and replies to posts. The first application will utilize Sentiment Analysis using R programming to categorize users’ sentiments into two main groups: positive and negative. Furthermore, the project also aims to identify and categorize the underlying themes/topics found within the posts/dataset and then categorize them based on their sentiments. The second application will utilize topic modelling using R programming to discover abstract “topics” that occur within the Facebook posts.
All in all, it enables a deeper understanding of how Facebook users react and express their opinions concerning the different discussion topics within the Facebook post /discussion.
With this information generated, major stakeholders in Facebook can better create and direct a peaceful environment for the Facebook community
